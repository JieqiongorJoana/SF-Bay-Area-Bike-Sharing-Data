# SF-Bay-Area-Bike-Sharing-Data
Bike sharing programs usually have a problem of unbalanced stations where the number of trips from these stations is higher than the number of trips to these stations (or vice versa). By anaylyzing the bike trips, based on the influencial factors such as trip time, weather, location of the stations, we will to find out the net change of each bike station. Then, we will figure out the unbalanced stations and recommand how to better allocate bicycles in different bike stations.
